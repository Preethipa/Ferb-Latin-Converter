# Ferb-Latin-Converter

Welcome to my profilio! I make this translation app by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS learned from neog.camp.
Use this converter, convert your text from English to Ferb-Latin.

The below text is to explain my project detials.

I made this app by using Visual Studio code.
First, create three seperate file for app.js, html file, and style file.

In program,

Step-1: create textarea.
Step-2: add button.
Step-3: create box for show output.
Step-4: wiring textarea input.
Step-5: add event listener.
Step-6: Wire a div to show output by using querySelector.

It is same procedure for that made in minions fun app.
